VGG16 (also called OxfordNet) is a convolutional neural 
network architecture named after the Visual Geometry Group from Oxford, 
who developed it. It was used to win the ILSVR (ImageNet) competition in 2014. 
To this day is it still considered to be an excellent vision model.

Import and use the same model on our dataset to classify an image as a cat 
or bus.
