Instructions
---------------------------------

Detection model(faster_rcnn_inception_resnet_v2_atrous_coco_2018_01_28) 
pre-trained on the COCO dataset.

I have downloaded and ran the pre-trained model.

Results folder contains output of the model on some sample images.
This model is much better in detecting objects than basic ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_11_06_2017 model.

01_object_detection_tutorial.py file contains code to run the model on images.


02_object_detection_tutorial.py file contains code to run the model on webcam.
