Random Forest

Apply random forest algorithm on a cellular network provider's dataset and 
predict if the person will churn or not.

First a decision tree model is built and is checked for overfitting.

Bagging model is built next to see how overfitting can be handled.

Then a random forest is built and its parameters are tuned to see
variation in recall,accuracy and overfitting.
